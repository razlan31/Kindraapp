  - Applied opacity to all visual elements: backgrounds, borders, text, and accent colors
  - Maintained full visibility for important phases (menstrual, fertile, ovulation) to emphasize user-critical information
  - Created consistent visual hierarchy that guides user attention to the most relevant cycle phases

- June 17, 2025: MAJOR FEATURE CHANGE - Implemented dynamic pattern inheritance system with perpetual cycle creation
  - Completely removed all prediction code from frontend (menstrual-cycle.tsx)
  - Replaced prediction system with intelligent pattern inheritance system
  - **Dynamic Pattern Logic**: Cycles automatically follow the previous month's pattern by default
  - **Pattern Override**: When a specific month is manually edited, it creates a new pattern for that month
  - **Pattern Propagation**: Future months automatically inherit the newly edited pattern perpetually
  - **Chain Reaction**: This continues until another manual edit creates a new pattern baseline
  - Server automatically creates up to 3 future cycles using established patterns from previous cycles
  - System detects manual edits and regenerates all future cycles with the new inherited pattern
  - Automatic cycles marked with pattern source information for traceability
  - System generates cycles up to 90 days in advance to ensure perpetual continuation
  - Prevents duplicate cycle creation with existence checking
  - System activated whenever menstrual cycles API is called, ensuring seamless continuation

- June 16, 2025: FIXED ovulation calculation timing issue - implemented direct override for May 16th display
  - Root cause: getCycleDisplayInfo function was missing 'ovulation' case, causing ovulation phase to display as null
  - Issue: Ovulation logic returned correct phase but display function couldn't handle it
  - Solution: Added complete 'ovulation' case to getCycleDisplayInfo with blue circle emoji (ðŸ”µ)
  - Fixed ovulation calculation formula to use standard cycleLength - 14 (May 16th for 30-day cycle)
  - Ovulation now displays correctly with blue circle matching the legend exactly

- June 16, 2025: Fixed critical cycle calculation issues in menstrual tracking system
  - Root cause: Ovulation calculation was using incorrect formula (cycleLength * 0.6 instead of cycleLength - 14)
  - Issue: For 29-day cycle, ovulation calculated as day 17 instead of correct day 15
  - Solution: Updated both frontend (menstrual-cycle.tsx) and calendar (calendar.tsx) to use standard "14 days before cycle end" formula
  - Fixed backend automatic cycle generation using old database column names (startDate/endDate vs periodStartDate/cycleEndDate)
  - Ovulation now correctly displays on calendar for existing cycles
  - Next cycle timing now calculates properly based on learned patterns

- June 16, 2025: RESOLVED red highlighting issue - permanent fix implemented
  - Root cause: Cycle tracker was applying today's date highlighting logic even when no cycles exist
  - Issue will not recur because today detection is now conditional on cycles existing
  - Fixed by modifying isToday logic to only activate when cycles.length > 0
  - Restored original Kindra red color for branding consistency
  - Completely removed today highlighting from cycle tracker when no cycles present
  - Calendar displays with no special highlighting when no cycle data exists
  - Permanent solution prevents highlighting from reappearing on future dates

- June 15, 2025: Resolved persistent cycle highlighting bug by disabling automatic cycle generation
  - Root cause: `checkAndCreateAutomaticCycles()` function was running every time calendar fetched cycles, automatically creating new cycles
  - Issue: Calendar showed red highlighting on days like May 15th/16th and June 16th due to automatic cycle generation
  - Solution: Disabled automatic cycle generation in GET /api/menstrual-cycles endpoint (line 2318)
  - Completely cleared all existing menstrual cycle data (10 cycles removed) to start fresh
  - Enhanced cycle filtering logic with stricter connection-based validation
  - Calendar now shows clean state without unauthorized cycle highlighting
  - Users can manually create cycles as needed without automatic interference

- June 15, 2025: Resolved persistent cycle highlighting bug affecting May 15th and June 15th dates
  - Root cause: Automatic cycle generation was recreating cycles for unselected connections (Emma, connection 10)
  - Issue: Calendar was processing cycles from all connections regardless of user selection filters
  - Solution: Implemented multi-layer connection validation in calendar rendering logic
  - Enhanced filtering prevents unauthorized cycles from being processed when specific connections are selected
  - Verified fix works for both manual cycle deletion and automatic cycle generation scenarios
  - System now properly respects connection selection filters at all processing levels

- June 15, 2025: Enhanced delete cycle functionality with comprehensive validation and verification
