integrating a calendar view on the main page will help users visualize their menstrual cycle, fights, and sexual intimacy (or patterns of emotional intimacy) in a clear and engaging way. This can help the user see the correlation between these events and make better decisions in their relationships.
Let’s break down how we can structure and integrate this feature:

Calendar Feature Overview
The calendar will visually display:
* Menstrual Cycle (user’s and partner’s).
* Logged Fights (conflicts).
* Sexual Intimacy (or emotional intimacy moments).
* This allows users to see patterns over time, correlating emotional events with their menstrual cycles and sexual intimacy.

1. Menstrual Cycle on Calendar
Goal: Show the menstrual cycle of the user and their partner (if they are tracking it) on the calendar.
* User’s Menstrual Cycle: Mark the start and end of their menstrual cycle. It will show as a color-coded period (e.g., red for menstruation days).
* Partner’s Menstrual Cycle: If the user adds their partner's menstrual cycle data, it will also be shown in a different color (e.g., blue).
How It Ties In:
* This will be useful to identify hormonal patterns and potentially correlate emotional states (e.g., fighting, intimacy) with their partner’s menstrual cycle.

2. Fights (Conflicts) on Calendar
Goal: Allow users to log conflicts (fights) and visually track them on the calendar.
* Fights/Conflicts: Each time a user logs a conflict (e.g., a fight with their partner), it will be marked on the calendar as a red flag or a warning sign (e.g., a small red dot or highlight).
* Users can add notes or tags to indicate the cause or significance of the fight.
How It Ties In:
* By tracking fights, users will be able to see if there’s a pattern (e.g., if fights often happen around certain menstrual phases or astrological signs).

3. Sexual Intimacy (or Emotional Intimacy) on Calendar
Goal: Track sexual intimacy (or emotional intimacy) moments and visualize their frequency and quality over time.
* Sexual Intimacy: Mark days when sexual intimacy occurs, and color-code them (e.g., green for good, yellow for neutral, and gray for missed days).
* Emotional Intimacy: If users log moments of emotional intimacy (affection, bonding), they can be marked as blue dots or another color.
How It Ties In:
* By tracking intimacy, users can see if it correlates with their menstrual cycle, fights, or other emotional factors, providing valuable insights about how intimacy and emotional states are interrelated.

4. Calendar Integration
The calendar would be a central hub where all of these events are displayed, making it easy to identify trends and patterns in the relationship.
Features of the Calendar:
* Color-coded events: Menstrual cycle, fights, intimacy.
* Tooltip or pop-up on hover or click: Display details when hovering over or clicking on any event on the calendar (e.g., "Fight on [Date]: Argument about [topic]").
* Daily view: Each day can show multiple events or mood tags (e.g., "Conflict", "Happy Moment", "Sexual Intimacy").
* Pattern Analysis: Optionally, the app can give an analysis based on logged events (e.g., "Your intimacy seems to increase after the 5th day of your partner's menstrual cycle").

Implementation
Frontend (UI/UX):
1. Calendar UI:
    * A monthly calendar view.
    * Use color-coding to represent different types of events (red for conflict, blue for intimacy, green for sexual intimacy, etc.).
    * Each day can show multiple types of events stacked or as icons (e.g., a red dot for conflict, blue dot for intimacy).
2. Log Events:
    * When logging a conflict, sexual intimacy, or menstrual cycle, the user should have the option to select a date or the date should be automatically logged based on the current day.
    * A pop-up window or form for adding the event with specific fields (e.g., mood, tags, satisfaction).
3. Pattern Insights:
    * The app can automatically analyze the calendar data to show patterns. For example: "You tend to have more fights on days when your partner is in their menstrual cycle's luteal phase."

Example User Journey:
1. User Logs In:
    * Upon logging in, the user is presented with their relationship calendar.
2. Log Menstrual Cycle:
    * The user logs their menstrual cycle start and end dates.
    * If they have a partner, they can input their partner’s cycle as well.
3. Log Intimacy:
    * The user logs a sexual intimacy moment (e.g., “Great night of connection!”), and it’s marked on the calendar as a green dot.
4. Log a Conflict:
    * The user logs a conflict (e.g., "Argument about planning") on a certain day, marked as a red dot.
5. View Patterns:
    * The user can hover over the dots on the calendar to see event details.
    * Over time, the app will show pattern analysis (e.g., "You’ve had more intimacy days during your partner’s follicular phase of the menstrual cycle").
6. Reflections:
    * AI-powered reflections based on the patterns:
        * "It seems your intimacy is more frequent during your partner’s follicular phase. Consider discussing this connection further!"
        * "There are frequent conflicts around your partner’s luteal phase — communication may help reduce these tensions."

Key Considerations
* User Control: Users should be able to toggle whether or not they want to see menstrual cycles or partner’s data on the calendar.
* Private Mode: Since sensitive data is involved, ensure that all data related to intimacy, cycles, or fights can be kept private if needed (i.e., users can decide to make this visible or not).

What’s the Benefit of This Integration?
* Holistic Relationship Tracking: By integrating the menstrual cycle, intimacy, and conflict data in a calendar view, the user can gain insights into their relationship that reflect not just emotional moments but also physical and biological patterns.
* Personalized Reflection: The app can give AI reflections based on these patterns, providing actionable insights to help improve the relationship.

Let Me Know:
* If this calendar design and integration fit your vision, or if you’d like me to adjust any part of it. I can refine it further or help with additional details!

Instead of asking the user directly if a moment is related to their menstrual cycle, we can display the current phase of the user's menstrual cycle on the moment logging page. This allows the user to make their own informed assumptions about how their current cycle may be influencing their mood or relationship dynamics.
How to Implement This:
1. Show Current Menstrual Cycle Phase:
    * On the Moment Logging page, display a small widget or status box showing the user’s current menstrual cycle phase (e.g., Follicular Phase, Luteal Phase, Ovulation, Menstrual Phase).
    * This allows users to track where they are in their cycle without needing to answer any specific question.
    * Display current cycle details such as days remaining, phase, and symptoms (if desired).
2. Make It Optional for Partner:
    * If the user is tracking their partner's menstrual cycle, show the partner’s current cycle phase as well, allowing the user to see any correlations.
3. Reflective Feedback:
    * The AI can still provide reflections based on the menstrual phase for moments logged. For example:
        * "You’re currently in your ovulation phase — hormonal shifts may be affecting your emotional connection today."
4. Visualizing the Phase:
    * Calendar Integration: As part of the calendar view, visually highlight the current phase in the user’s cycle and update the phase color as they move through it.

Example Flow and UI/UX for Cycle Display
1. Menstrual Cycle Display:
On the Moment Logging Page, you can have something like this displayed:
* User’s Menstrual Cycle:
    * Phase: Follicular Phase
    * Days Remaining: 5 days left
    * Symptoms: Increased energy, mood swings
    * Optional: A small icon or a color-coded bar to represent the phase on the profile or calendar.
UI Example (on Moment Logging Form):
yaml
Copy
| User's Menstrual Cycle |
|------------------------|
| Current Phase: Follicular |
| Days Left: 5 Days      |
| Symptoms: Increased Energy  |
|                        |
| Mood: [Dropdown]       |
| Tags: [Input Field]    |
| Note: [Text Area]      |
| Media URL: [Input]     |
|------------------------|

2. Menstrual Cycle on Calendar:
The calendar view can display the user’s current cycle phase visually:
* For example, the Follicular Phase could be marked with a blue bar at the top of the calendar.
* Ovulation phase could be marked with yellow.
* Luteal Phase and Menstruation phases can have their own distinct colors.

Benefits of This Approach:
1. Increased Awareness: By displaying the current phase, the user can see and reflect on how their menstrual cycle might affect their emotions and relationship dynamics. For instance, the app can provide insights like:
    * "You’re in the luteal phase — this could be why you're feeling more emotional today."
2. No Need for Additional Questions: Instead of asking users to explicitly identify if their moment is related to their cycle, the app just shows them where they are in their cycle, allowing the user to make their own assumptions.
3. Visualize Patterns: This setup allows users to see patterns between their cycle phases and relationship moments (e.g., more intimacy during ovulation, more conflicts in the luteal phase).

Next Steps:
1. Display Current Cycle: Ensure the current cycle phase is displayed clearly on the Moment Logging Page.
2. Calendar Integration: Visualize the menstrual cycle phases on the calendar so users can see patterns over time.
3. Reflection AI: Make the AI context-aware based on the phase, providing personalized insights about how their cycle might be affecting their mood and relationship dynamics.

This method will allow users to track and reflect on their menstrual cycle naturally, without the need for constant prompts or questions, and help them connect the dots between their cycle and relationship patterns.
