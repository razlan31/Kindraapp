Overview of the App‚Äôs Features
User Authentication

Login & Registration: Users can create an account and log in using their email and password.

After logging in, the user is taken to their profile page where they can track relationships, menstrual cycles, intimacy, and more.

Profile Management

Users can manage multiple relationships. They can add multiple partners to their profile (e.g., Partner 1, Partner 2).

Each partner will have their own section in the profile, where their menstrual cycle, intimacy moments, and conflict logs are tracked.

Main Focus Connection

The user can select a main focus partner. This is the partner they want to prioritize for insights, AI reflections, and calendar tracking.

The calendar and insights will display data only for the focused connection. Users can switch the focus at any time to track different relationships.

Key Features:
Moment Logging

Users can log moments related to:

Mood: Happy, Neutral, Unhappy.

Tags: Green Flag, Affection, Conflict, Intimacy, etc.

Note: A text input where users can add context to the moment.

Media: Optional images or videos to accompany the logged moment.

Sexual Intimacy Tracking

Users can log sexual intimacy moments separately, with the option to rate satisfaction (Good, Neutral, Needs Improvement).

The app will analyze the frequency of intimacy and give insights on patterns (e.g., intimacy increases during certain hormonal phases).

Conflict Tracking

Users can log conflicts or fights, specifying the reason or cause (e.g., Jealousy, Miscommunication, Stress).

The app will help correlate conflicts with the partner‚Äôs menstrual cycle and give insights on how hormonal changes may affect emotional dynamics.

Menstrual Cycle Tracking

Users (and their partners) can log their menstrual cycle (start and end dates).

The app will display the current phase (e.g., Follicular, Ovulation, Luteal, Menstruation) and give insights into how the phase may affect the user's mood, relationship dynamics, and sexual intimacy.

AI reflections will be generated based on the current cycle phase and logged moments (e.g., "You might feel more emotional during your partner‚Äôs luteal phase ‚Äî communication could help reduce conflicts").

Milestone and Anniversary Tracking

Users can log important relationship milestones (e.g., First Date, First Kiss, Engagement, Marriage) and anniversaries (e.g., dating or marriage anniversary).

These milestones will appear in the calendar, with special icons (e.g., üéâ for anniversaries, ‚≠êÔ∏è for milestones).

The app will send reminders before these events, encouraging users to reflect and celebrate.

Calendar View

The calendar is the main hub where users can visually track good moments, conflicts, intimacy, milestones, and anniversaries.

The calendar is color-coded to differentiate between types of events:

Green: Sexual intimacy

Red: Conflict

Blue: Menstrual phase

Gold/Yellow: Milestone or anniversary

Multiple Partner Support: Users can view separate calendars for each partner or switch between partners easily.

Log Moments: The user logs moods, conflicts, sexual intimacy, and good moments (e.g., "Had a great date night").

"You had more intimacy during Partner 1‚Äôs follicular phase."
