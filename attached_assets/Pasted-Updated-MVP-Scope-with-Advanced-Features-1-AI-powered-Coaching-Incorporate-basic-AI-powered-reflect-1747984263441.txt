Updated MVP Scope with Advanced Features
1. AI-powered Coaching
Incorporate basic AI-powered reflections immediately as part of the MVP.

Add insights and nudges based on logged moments:

For example, personalized emotional growth advice could be triggered based on the number of positive moments or emotional patterns.

Sophisticated nudges like: "You’ve logged several moments of growth with [Connection]. Want to explore what’s making this relationship strong?"

Rule-based AI will provide these nudges until the ML-based insights can be introduced in future versions.

2. Horoscope Compatibility & Emotional Insights
Horoscope input: Allow users to enter their zodiac sign at registration or in their profile settings.

Horoscope compatibility tracking: Display emotional insights based on their zodiac compatibility with each connection.

Daily/Weekly emotional insights: AI could pull compatibility predictions or emotional patterns based on both users’ signs, displayed as simple prompts or reflections (e.g., "Your Aries & Leo connection seems full of energy today! Keep nurturing that spark!").

This can be optional for users who believe in it.

3. Love Language Tracking
User & partner love language tracking: Ask users to select their love language (from The 5 Love Languages) and that of their connections.

Reflective prompts: Based on logged moments, users could receive personalized reflections like:

"Your partner’s primary love language is Acts of Service, have you noticed them doing something thoughtful for you recently?"

Badge system integration: Badges for identifying and growing emotional connections based on love languages.

4. Menstrual Cycle Tracking Integrated with Emotional Insights
Cycle tracking: Allow users (optional) to log their menstrual cycle for personalized insights and pattern tracking.

Track cycle phases (e.g., menstruation, follicular, ovulation, luteal)

Log mood changes and emotional states linked to cycle stages

AI-powered insights: Offer emotional insights that tie mood fluctuations to the cycle phases, helping users understand and manage emotional patterns in their relationships during specific times of the month.

Incorporating these features in the MVP will provide a more comprehensive app that covers a wide range of emotional insights and relationship tracking, giving users immediate value. Here’s how we could balance the speed and quality:
Start with Rule-Based AI for reflections and nudges — this will be faster to implement and still provide meaningful insights.

Horoscope and Love Languages can be included as optional fields in the user profile, allowing users to decide whether they want to enable these features.

Menstrual Cycle Tracking can be simplified for the MVP as basic logging with cycle phases and emotional insights, without requiring a complex medical-grade tracking system.
