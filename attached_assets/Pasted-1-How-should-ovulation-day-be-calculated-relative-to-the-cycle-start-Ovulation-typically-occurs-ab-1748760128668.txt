1. How should ovulation day be calculated relative to the cycle start?
Ovulation typically occurs about 14 days before the next period begins, not necessarily on day 14 of the cycle unless the person has a perfect 28-day cycle.

To calculate it relative to the cycle start:

Ovulation Day = Cycle Length - Luteal Phase Length

The luteal phase is usually around 14 days for most people, but it can range from 12–16 days.

So if a user has a 30-day cycle, ovulation likely occurs on day 16 (30 - 14 = 16).

Make sure your app allows for variations in cycle length, and ideally luteal phase length too, for better accuracy.

2. How many days should the ovulation phase span?
The ovulation phase is short: ovulation itself is a single day, when the egg is released.

However, the fertile window (when pregnancy is possible) is typically 6 days:

5 days before ovulation (due to sperm lifespan)

1 day of ovulation (egg survives ~24 hours)

So while the ovulation day is one specific day, your "ovulation phase" or "fertile window" can span 6 days, usually ending the day after ovulation.

3. What should be the timing for the luteal phase?
The luteal phase starts right after ovulation and ends the day before the next period.

It's usually consistently 12–16 days for each person, even if their overall cycle length varies.

For most, 14 days is a good estimate, but allowing customization improves accuracy.

TL;DR for your app logic:
Use: Ovulation Day = Cycle Length - Luteal Phase Length

Default Luteal Phase: 14 days (but allow for 12–16 if tracking)

Ovulation Phase/Fertile Window: 6 days (5 before ovulation, 1 on ovulation)

Avoid assuming ovulation is always on Day 14 unless the cycle is exactly 28 days

Absolutely! Here's how you can structure the UI for a menstrual cycle tracker to reflect accurate ovulation and cycle phase tracking. I'll break it into key UI components with best practices for clarity and user control.

🗓 1. Calendar View (Main UI)
Highlight Phases with Colors:

🟦 Menstrual Phase: Red or pink (e.g., Day 1–5)

🟨 Follicular Phase: Light yellow or neutral (from end of period to ovulation)

🟩 Fertile Window: Green (5 days before and including ovulation day)

🟪 Ovulation Day: Bold highlight or special icon (e.g., egg icon on that day)

🟫 Luteal Phase: Purple or orange (from day after ovulation to next period)

UI Features:

Tap a day to see details (e.g., “Day 14 – Estimated Ovulation”)

Swipe to view other months

Predict next period start with dotted line or forecast icon

⚙️ 2. Settings Panel or Onboarding Flow
Custom Inputs:

Average cycle length (e.g., 28 days)
– Use a number picker

Period duration (e.g., 5 days)
– Number picker or slider

Luteal phase length (default: 14 days; editable: 12–16 days)
– Optional, but allow if user tracks BBT or uses ovulation tests

Toggle Options:

 "Use default 14-day luteal phase"

 "Customize fertile window length"

🔎 3. Fertility & Phase Info Panel (Optional but Great for UX)
When a user taps on a date, show a bottom sheet or modal:

sql
Copy
Edit
📅 June 12
🟪 Ovulation Day
🟩 Fertile Window (Day 5 of 6)
📊 Chances of conception: High
🧬 Luteal Phase begins tomorrow
You can also show hormones expected (e.g., LH peak, estrogen drop) if you want to educate users.

🧠 4. Logic Behind the UI
Let’s assume:

User sets cycle length = 30 days

Luteal phase = 14 days (default)

Then:

Ovulation = Day 16

Fertile window = Day 11–16

Menstrual phase = Day 1–5

Luteal = Day 17–30

The calendar should visually mark these ranges accordingly.

✅ Pro Tips for UX:
Use subtle gradients across phases to imply transition

Label each phase in a legend or with tooltips

Offer cycle insights ("Your next fertile window starts in 3 days")
